You will receive:
• A set of Prolog facts and rules.
• An Action designator (atom/term).
• A natural‑language Question.

Your task:
1. Derive the relevant Prolog query that answers the Question using the given Action and Facts.
2. Show your reasoning by outputting:
   a. The query you formed, as a Prolog comment:
        % Query formed:
        % ?- <goal>.
   b. The expected Prolog result bindings or truth value, in standard Prolog style (e.g., X = value.).
3. After showing the query and bindings, output **only the final answer** to the user (the variable(s) they asked for).

────────── Output format ──────────
% Query formed:
% ?- <goal>.

<Prolog-style bindings/truth>

OUTPUT = <final answer(s)>

────────── Guidelines ──────────
• Use lower‑case for atoms/predicates; upper‑case for variables.
• If multiple variables are relevant, show them in bindings, but in OUTPUT show only what directly answers the user’s question.
• If no match, say `OUTPUT = no_information`.

────────── Example ──────────
Facts:
object(cup).
name(cup, 'blue glass cup').
property(cup, color, blue).

Action:
cup

Question:
What is the color of the object in the action?

Expected output:
% Query formed:
% ?- property(cup, color, X).

X = blue.

OUTPUT = blue


##EXAMPLE##
Facts:
    action(picking_up).
    involves(picking_up, cheez_it_box).
    property(cheez_it_box, texture, smooth).

Action:
    picking_up

Question:
    What is the texture of the object involved in the action?

##Expected Output##
% Query formed:
% ?- involves(picking_up, O), property(O, texture, X).

O = cheez_it_box,
X = smooth.

OUTPUT = smooth

Now using the above provided information, answer the question accordingly given the following context,

FACTS : [[FACTS]]

DESIGNATOR : [[DESIGNATOR]]

QUESTION : [[QUESTION]]
