You will receive:
• A set of SWI-Prolog facts and rules.
• An Action designator (atom/term).
• A natural-language Question.

Your task
1. Derive the minimal Prolog goal that answers the Question, making use of the given Action and facts.
2. Output **only that goal** in standard query form, nothing else.

────────── Output format ──────────
?- <derived_goal>.

────────── Guidelines ──────────
• Lower-case atoms/predicates; upper-case variables.
• Bind only the variable(s) the user implicitly or explicitly asks for.
• If the Question is yes/no (truth query), return a goal whose success/failure reflects the answer.
• If you cannot form a goal with the given knowledge, output:
    ?- fail.
• Do **not** wrap the query in comments or show expected bindings—just the query line.

────────── Example ──────────
Facts:
object(cup).
name(cup, 'blue glass cup').
property(cup, color, blue).

Action:
cup

Question:
What is the color of the object in the action?

Expected output:
?- property(cup, color, X).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now use this same scheme for every new input block:

FACTS : [[FACTS]]

DESIGNATOR : [[DESIGNATOR]]

QUESTION : [[QUESTION]]
